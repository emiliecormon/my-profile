				<h1>Hello!! I am Emilie Cormon. Nice to meet you ðŸ˜Š</h1>

				<h2>My hobbies</h2>
					<p>I love everything that has some creativity in it. Which is why I like to listen to music, watch new movies, do some photography, draw, dance and go to new places as well as visiting museums. </p>

				<h2>My current achievements</h2>
					<p>I am a student at Ieseg Paris and following the English track. Ieseg is known as an international school with the 3 acreditations AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA. It is also ranked in the top 10 national business schools. Moreover, I found an internship for 2022 in my dream company Dior. Finally, next year, I will be living for 6 months in Maastricht doing my exchange in Maastricht Universiy, which is in Shanghai's top 500 and also has the 3 accreditations.</p>

				<h2>My future objectives/ projects</h2>
					<p>As I always loved to travel, I believe that these are the best years for me to take this opportunity to go where I wish in the world. However, I intend to also build myself a future in the luxury sector as I always wished when I was young. Thus, I believe I should take a gap year between my bachelor and my master during which I would find an intership in the group LVMH in Seoul and maybe spend the other 6 months of this gap year in Singapore still in the luxe industry.</p>
